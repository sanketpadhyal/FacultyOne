## 🚀 About FacultyOne

FacultyOne is a secure academic cloud platform built exclusively for educators.

It enables verified faculty members to store, manage, and access teaching materials from any device — including live classroom systems, projectors, and smart boards.

The platform eliminates unsafe practices like USB drives, shared logins, and personal cloud usage on public systems by introducing:

• One-time classroom access tokens  
• Encrypted cloud storage  
• Session-based secure access  

---

## 🎯 Why FacultyOne?

Educators often face:

- Carrying pendrives  
- Logging into personal drives on public PCs  
- Emailing files to themselves  
- Data leaks and account risk  

FacultyOne solves this with:

✅ Secure cloud storage  
✅ Temporary classroom sessions  
✅ Auto-expiring access tokens  
✅ Verified educator-only access

## 📝 How It Works

1. Educator registers on FacultyOne  
2. Admin reviews & approves account  
3. Educator uploads academic materials  
4. Educator generates up to 5 temporary classroom access tokens  
5. Token is used once to open a secure classroom session and is immediately invalidated  
6. Files open securely within the session and cannot be reused

## 🔒 Security Model

- Firebase authentication for verified user access  
- Supabase secure storage integration  
- Session-based access control  
- Signed time-limited file URLs  
- Role-based admin permissions  

> Currently the storage bucket is operating in public mode for early-stage deployment, but files remain protected through signed expiring URLs and secure session layers.

> Once user volume grows and initial funding is arranged, the storage system will be migrated to fully private backend-controlled buckets with no architectural changes required.
