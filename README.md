## 🚀 About FacultyOne

FacultyOne is a secure academic cloud platform built exclusively for educators.

It enables verified faculty members to store, manage, and access teaching materials from any device — including live classroom systems, projectors, and smart boards.

The platform eliminates unsafe practices like USB drives, shared logins, and personal cloud usage on public systems by introducing:

• One-time classroom access tokens  
• Encrypted cloud storage  
• Session-based secure access

## 🎯 Why FacultyOne?

Educators often face:

- Carrying pendrives  
- Logging into personal drives on public PCs  
- Emailing files to themselves  
- Data leaks and account risk  

FacultyOne solves this with:

✅ Secure cloud storage  
✅ Temporary classroom sessions  
✅ Auto-expiring access tokens  
✅ Verified educator-only access
